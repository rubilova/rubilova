https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rejuvenate-fitness/id6502963558

I’m building Rejuvenate from concept to production — handling engineering, product strategy, UX, data design and AppStore updates.

## Key accomplishments:

- Built a fully native SwiftUI fitness app from the ground up, leading architecture, design, and feature development across Explore, Schedule, and Guided Workout Flow. 
- Implemented advanced video and image caching, custom audio guidance and a modular view model architecture. 
- Developed a Firebase/Cloud Functions backend powering routines, streaks, scheduling, and user profiles with secure rules and time-zone aware logic.
- Designed polished user experiences, onboarding, and UI components; created extensive guided exercise content; and produced App Store assets and the public marketing website. 
- Integrated analytics, notifications, and prefetching systems to improve engagement and performance. 
- Oversaw product strategy, roadmap, and end-to-end delivery—combining engineering, fitness expertise, and product ownership to ship a production-ready training platform.

Rejuvenate represents the full spectrum of my skills — engineering, product ownership, design thinking, and deep domain knowledge in fitness.
